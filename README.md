# Health Data Sharing Consent Manager

## Description

The **Health Data Sharing Consent Manager** is a Move smart contract module designed for managing user consent over the sharing of personal health data on the Aptos blockchain. It empowers users to selectively and securely grant or revoke access to specific health information, ensuring user control, transparency, and data protection.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a **decentralized health data ecosystem** where individuals have complete ownership and control over their personal health records. This module lays the foundation for a user-centric healthcare system by enabling secure, consent-based data sharing among patients, healthcare providers, insurers, and researchers.

## Future Scope

The current version supports basic consent granting and revocation. Future enhancements may include:

* **Fine-grained access controls** (e.g., time-limited, use-case-specific sharing).
* **Consent history/auditing logs** for transparency and traceability.
* **Integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems**.
* **Cross-chain interoperability** for broader data sharing.
* **Role-based permissions** for healthcare institutions and applications.
* **Encrypted data links** associated with each consent.
